Each of the entry to the 4x4x4 Connect 4! board is represented by

[7 8 9 0]

[Y U I O]

[G H J K]

[V B N M]

keys on your keyboard.

The game has a red player (player 1) and a blue player (player 2).

The game starts with red player first, and after each player's ball entry, the player swaps.

The first to connect 4 balls of one's color wins, but only horizontal / vertical connections count (no diagonal connections for the win).

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
